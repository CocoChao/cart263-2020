# Challenge: Eat Up Extension

__This is an ungraded challenge. It is here to provide you with something to work on if you're looking for a focal point for the week.__

---

## Brief

Extend the "Eat Up" activity code in some or all of the following ways:

- Create an "add new fly" button which, when clicked, inserts another fly onto the page with the same behaviors as the original (consider adding the new fly to a random position on the screen using `.offset()`)
- Add a shake effect with `.effect()` to the fly, so that it vibrates for as long as it's being dragged
- Add a progress bar widget to the page that indicates how hungry the mouth is, have it diminish over time (you'll need `setInterval()` or similar) and make the mouth "die" (in the manner of your choosing) if it reaches zero. Make the the bar increase whenever a fly is fed to the mouth.
