# Challenge: Circle Eater

__This is an ungraded challenge. It is here to provide you with something to work on if you're looking for a focal point for the week.__

---

## Brief

Improve the "Circle Eater" code from Week 1's activity in some or all of the following ways:

- Replace all hard-coded values with constants (if they are unchanging numbers) or variables/properties (if they need to change or are better expressed this way)
- Replace all repeated code with functions (e.g. the food repositioning code is repeated twice and should be a function)
- Add a scoring system that count how many food items are eaten before the player dies
- Add title and game over screens
- Add the ability to reset the game when the player dies
- Convert the code into an object-oriented program with at least a Food and Player class to handle the functionality of those elements. Consider using inheritance to create an Agent class for both to inherit from that can consolidate functionality shared by both (such as various properties and the ability to display on screen)

## Learning objectives

- (Re)establishing confidence with basic JavaScript programming and the p5 library
