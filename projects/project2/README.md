## Requirements

- Must be interactive and it should be primarily the interactive aspect that provokes us to think about some aspect of Bridle's essay (e.g. not just the aesthetics)

- Must include speech synthesis or voice commands or both
- Must include an Artist's Statement as a README.md in the project folder that explains the creative ideas behind the project (minimum of 500 words)

## Grading

Grading for exercises is based on the following three categories (with associated weightings):

__Implementation (50%)__. Runs without errors. Meets the key technical requirements. Exhibits complexity/ambition of code. Uses technical ideas and features that go beyond what has been seen in class. Has clear indication of code obtained from other sources (e.g. StackExchange, examples on website). Code is well-structured and easy to understand.

__Creativity (30%)__. Uses code to create an interesting and expressive experience for the user. Has a clear point of view and conveys it well. Uses code in surprising ways to create new ideas. Goes beyond the most obvious uses of the chosen technologies. Artist's statement clearly explains the design and implementation in terms of its desire effect.

__Style (20%)__. the code is well-commented, well-formatted and indented, uses good names for variables, functions, classes, etc., attributes the use of pre-existing code, and has a good number of commits with well-written commit messages that include the project prefix "P3:".
