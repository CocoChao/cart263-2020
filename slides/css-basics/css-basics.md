## CSS

- Stands for __Cascading Style Sheets__
- It is the language we use to express the __visual style__ of web pages
- Targets HTML tags and attributes to select specific parts of a page to style
- Uses a very recognizable style of attributes and properties
- Generally lives in a text file with extension `.css`

## A stylesheet

```css
body {
  font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;
  font-size: 1em;
}

#main-heading {
  font-size: 2em;
  color: silver;
}

.main-text {
  font-family: Times, serif;
}
```

- Note the basic form of a __selector__ (`body`, `#main-heading`, `.main-text`) and a set of __properties__
- Note that a selector can be a __tag name__ or an __id__ (prefixed with `#`) or __class__ (prefixed with `.`) name
